I am a Data Scientist living in Asia. In June 2016 I received my SM in Management Studies from the MIT Sloan School of Management, and in February 2017 I received my MBA from the Graduate School of Business At Seoul National University. My interests include statistical learning, data engineering, infrastructure, risk, and programming in Python, Scala, Bash, R and SQL.
